How many programming languages do you know?  Are they all basically the same,
with just different rules about where to place colons, parenthesis, and 
brackets?  Most popular languages today are basically C++ with variations.
C++ is great for some things, but when every popular language follows the
same basic paradigms many programmers don't even know that alternatives exist.

A programmer's greatest tool is his programming language.  However, most
programmers do not make enough use of this tool.  Many programmers learn
only enough of their programming language to do basic tasks and call libraries
to do the rest.  This often leaves the true expressive power of their chosen 
programming language untapped, wasting hours of the programmers time that
could have been better used debugging instead of typing.  In addition, knowing
the particular nuances of <emphasis>other languages</emphasis> allow 
programmers to know when their current language is getting in their way 
rather than helping them to solve the problem.

The goal of this book is to introduce you to a wide variety of programming
language constructs which greatly increase your power as a programmer.  Some
of the constructs just save typing, but some of them lead to a vastly different
method of thinking about and arranging your program.  Not all of these ideas 
apply to all programming languages, but they will help you find new ways to 
think about programming, and let you know when another language might be more
adequate at finding a solution.

Programming Language Concepts:
Tools for State Management and Flow Control

-- discuss how state management and flow control are the fundamental problems
being addressed in programming languages (find lesser ones, like maybe
interoperability)

-- discuss why good state management tools are needed in large projects

-- we are developing a language, but the language features can also
   be used by assembly language programs for enhanced state management
   and flow control

-- discuss runtime vs compile-time constructs, how they affect speed,
implementation, flexibility, etc.

You may have learned a few programming languages by now, all of which have
a great number of features that simplify programming.  This is excellent.
Maximizing productivity in programming is about knowing your tools and
knowing how they work.  Knowing a programming language is good, but you
will never master it until you learn how it is implemented.

This book will go over a piece-by-piece dissection of the programming
language scheme.  Scheme was chosen for this book because of several reasons:

* It has a really simple syntax

* It only has a few facilities

* Those few facilities can be used to implement almost every other programming construct in popular use

-- State Management --

State Management - state is a collection of values

 -- anatomy of values

 -- a generic value structure

 -- lifecycle of values

 -- basic values -- string and integer

 -- using our values

State Management - keeping track of variables

 -- symbol table

 -- scopes

 -- Using lists to keep track of symbols

 -- pairs and lists

 -- Symbol table implementation

 -- Stack frames, scope, and symbol tables

 -- Using the symbol table in a program

 -- Discussion of runtime vs. compile-time symbol tables

State Management - putting it together - standardized function template and
call frames

State Management - closures - saving symbol tables for later use

State Management - The Function Type
  -- code pointer
  -- closure

-- Building the Interpretter --

-- Flow Control  --

Basic elements

 -- Sequence, Selection, and Iteration
    (sequence is actually any non-flow-control statement)

Flow Control - Function calls ??

Flow Control - Continuations - remembering flow control

Flow Control - error exits, exceptions, etc

Flow Control - Coroutines

Flow Control - Threads and processes

-- State Management in object-oriented languages --

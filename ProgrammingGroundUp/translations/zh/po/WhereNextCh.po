"Congratulations on getting this far.  You should now have a basis for "
"understanding the issues involved in many areas of programming.  Even if you "
"never use assembly language again, you have gained a valuable perspective "

"Different people like different approaches, but a good programmer takes all "
"of them into account.  The bottom-up approaches help you understand the "
"machine aspects, the top-down approaches help you understand the "
"problem-area aspects, and the middle approaches help you with practical "
"questions and answers.  To leave any of these aspects out would be a "
"mistake."

"Computer Programming is a vast subject.  As a programmer, you will need to "
"be prepared to be constantly learning and pushing your limits.  These books "
"will help you do that.  They not only teach their subjects, but also teach "
"various ways and methods of <emphasis>thinking</emphasis>.  As Alan Perlis "
"said, \"A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming "
"is not worth knowing\" "
"(http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/perlis-alan/quotes.html).  If you are "
"constantly looking for new and better ways of doing and thinking, you will "
"make a successful programmer.  If you do not seek to enhance yourself, \"A "
"little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest - and "
"poverty will come on you like a bandit and scarcity like an armed man.\" "
"(Proverbs 24:33-34 NIV).  Perhaps not quite that severe, but still, it is "
"best to always be learning."

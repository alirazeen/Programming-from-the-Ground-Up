To build the images from the OOo Draw files, do the following:

Export to .eps
Run pstoimg -type png -density 300 FILENAME.eps
Open in gimp - autocrop.  Resize, but only use resize to set the DPI back to 300 (pstoimg doesn't actually save the DPI, it just saves it as a really big 72dpi graphic).  Save it as the same filename

You can now reference it with imagedata.  The tag looks like this:

<mediaobject>
<imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="filename.png" format="PNG" />
</imageobject>
<caption><para>Caption goes here</para></caption>
</mediaobject>
